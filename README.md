# FourierPOD
Supplementary material for my thesis.
Click [here](https://github.com/Mahdi-Hosseinali/FourierPOD/blob/master/FredholmAnalyticalSolution.ipynb) to view the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the analytical and numerical test functions.
The Fredholm integral equation is solved using space-only POD for all cases.
For the `u3` test function, the analysis involves Fourier transform in time and POD on each frequency.
